# moreSemantic-UCONN
## I made a more semantic version of the website provided but kept the same css styling
The task was to give more acessiablity to the pages for screen readers,search enginne optimization etc and aviod the practises of div soup. Instead you can use tags such as:
* Section
* Article 
* Aside 
* strong 
* header 
* footer 
etc.
Even though **changes aren't seen on the page** this is always an important practise to do when strucutring the html of the page
